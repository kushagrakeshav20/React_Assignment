            There's a feeling of silent boredom that one receives from the sight 
            of the  beach. The sand ripples in the visage of desolation, teems with
             dull undulating  waves slapping the sand with a bored "smack" without
              an echo. However, the  mountains are alive. They roll in a perpetual 
              explosion of color and movement  that floods the eyes and ears, fills
               the nose with soft aroma and the mouth with  sweet oxygen. The mountains
                are an intense arrangement of vivid color and form  unmatched by any 
                other type of geology. The beach huddles in a mass of ugliness  beside it. </p>

            The surrounding area is desolate, filled with cacti, brush, and the semi-frequent jackrabbit
             that is there to remind you of the surrounding animals whose kingdom you have called home 
             for the night.
             This may be their world but together we share the same experience of the daily rituals of 
             the sky. The phases of sunrise and sunset, where the sun gets replaced by the moon — the 
             constant to remind us of the sacredness of life.

            Have you ever experienced a night sky that pierced your heart and landed deep in your
             memory? I have. One night in August 2016, I had a powerful night sky moment, which
              made me think about the amazing skies I have seen. Of course, there have been some
               not so nice skies, foretelling bad weather — from hurricanes and tornadoes to sleet 
               and blizzards. And I have enjoyed cloudless sunrises glowing over several oceans,
                sparkling the vast dancing waters, and stretching out to embrace the beach and me;
                 I can never get enough of those moments. But that’s not what I thought of that August 
                 night. My mind focused on sunsets.
